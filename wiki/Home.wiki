== Welcome ==

the motivation behind this project is to create a OPAC module for [[http://obiblio.sourceforge.net/|openbiblio]]


=== Installation ===

* create a new database on your mysql server.
* import the sql file found under assets\sql\dump.sql
* go to opac\config\database.php and edit it to suite your needs

and that's it..remember this is just a preview...

Have fun!
